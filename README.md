# Restaurant

This app let's see the menu for a restaurant!

You will be able to choose between the appetizers and the entrees. When you've selected either of the two categories you'll be able to see all the
food that belong to that category. All the items in the list will feature a picture of the food, what the food is, and how much it costs.

When you click on a specific food item the app will take you to a more detailed page of that food item. You will want to go to this page if 
you want to see a bigger picture of the food, and if you see a description of the food.
